# FingerTwister

play the demo at https://timsoenksen.github.io/FingerTwister/

A basic twister game written in javascript.
put the corresponding finger on each color using your keyboard,
if you press down the wrong color or have too many fingers on a
certain color when pressed, down, the game will end.

some minor quality of life things still need to be added, but
this was a fun little project to brush up on javascript.
